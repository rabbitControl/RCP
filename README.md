# RCP
Remote Control Protocol

A binary data-format definition to describe data values and user interface elements.
It is intended to expose parameters (values) from a host application to a client in a defined way. It was created with UI clients in mind which update values at the host application. It can also be used in a non-UI case.

For details see [Specification](RCPSpecification.md)
